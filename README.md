Socket Programming Project
Socket is an interface between the application layer and transport layer.
Different types of sockets:
-> TCP/Stream Socket
-> UDP/Datagram Socket
-> Raw Socket

This socket programming project provides a communication between two computers and works on the command line.
•        The connection will continue as long as one of the sides sends the min data.

•        Seems like TCP acts like UDP on Wireshark…
